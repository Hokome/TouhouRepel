__Notes:__

- Hard to get used to repel timing probs
- "It's really a bullet hell"
- "What is the objective"
- Seems pretty challenge
- He's trying to camp near the enemies with varying success
- Confused by the pause in the middle
- The straight line seems satisfaying
- **I think it's hard to not get touched while you're focusing on shooting down enemies.**
- **"Aiming is really hard"**
- He does seem to like the challenge.
- "This is just like my first time playing dark souls".
- He didn't seem to notice the bullet patterns

__Questions:__

What was the most frustrating part?

*Getting the timing right.*

What was the best part?

*The wombo combos when you hit multiple enemies with one shot.*

What is one thing you would change, add or remove in the game?

*Add building up damage by bouncing balls.*

If you had a magic wand that could change, add or remove one thing in the game, what would you do?

*Faster movement, keep the absolute hell, more parry and unpariable bullets.*

What was your strategy?

*Watch and learn and then try to optimize.*

Any thoughts beyond that?

*Pretty fun game as it is and it could go really far.*

__Feedback:__

I like the idea of bouncing balls or something but it's too fast.
It was fun figuring out patterns and learning the game

__Conclusion:__

- __Make the enemies bigger__ so the player doesn't have to aim too precisely which also means bounce shots are more reliable.
- Make repel timing and hitbox more forgiving so the player can focus more on positioning and attacking.
- Objective should be clearer.
- Make opportunities for straight lines and shots that kill multiple enemies.
- The game seems like a good challenge type of game, like dark souls, which was intended.
